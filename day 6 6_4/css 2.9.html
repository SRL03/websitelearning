<p>sea beach,I wanted a short tour. So I selected Sajek. The place is in a remote area and thats why it has lack of many modern facilities like electricity, mobile networks. Water crisis is severe. But I gave it 4 out of 5 because it really fulfilled my purpose. I had to struggle very much for getting there, specially army escort will waste your many time. But if you want to get our of urban life and want to have some fresh air, then this is a good place. Just go there sit on a hill, look into the vast green horizon and take fresh air.</p>
