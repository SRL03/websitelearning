<p>The Bangladesh Armed Forces have inherited the institutional framework of the British military and the British Indian Army.[194] It was formed in 1971 from the military regiments of East Pakistan. In 2018 the active personnel strength of the Bangladesh Army was around 157,500,[195] excluding the <b>Air Force and the Navy</b> (24,000).[196] <strong>addition to traditional defence roles, the military has supported civil authorities</strong> in disaster relief and provided internal security during periods of political unrest. For many years, Bangladesh has been <b> the world's largest contributor to UN peacekeeping forces.</b> In February 2015, the country made major deployments to CÃ´te d'Ivoire, Cyprus, Darfur, the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Golan Heights, Haiti, Lebanon, Liberia and South Sudan.[197]</p>
